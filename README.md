## Description

`brdrQ` is a QGIS-processing plugin that aligns features (polygons) to reference borders: It searches for overlap
relevance between thematic borders and reference borders,
and creates a resulting border based on the overlapping areas that are relevant.
The algorithm can make (one or more) 'predictions' so the user can compare and choose the right aligned geometry.

The purpose of this plugin is to automatically adjust thematic boundaries (polygons) on a reference layer (polygons)
based on a 'relevant distance'. This parameter is used in the algorithm to determine where the boundaries are
effectively adjusted to the reference layer, or where the original boundary is preserved. Thus, the adjustment of the
boundaries of resulting geometries and original geometries is at most as large as the 'relevant distance'

## Installation

* Windows-users: Use the QGIS PluginManager to install brdrQ from the official QGIS-repo:
  <img src="docs/figures/plugin_list.png" width="50%" />

* Ubuntu/Linux/Mac: Please try to install brdrQ by using the QGIS PluginManager (see Windows-install). For newer
  versions of Ubuntu/Linux it could be needed to run QGIS inside a virtual environment. You can use the following script
  to create a virtual environment and run QGIS before following the installation steps
  below: [linux_venv_qgis.sh](dist/linux_venv_qgis.sh). Usage of the plugin on Mac is not tested, and can give errors or
  unexpected behaviour.

### Pre-requisites

- QGIS >3.34.8: The plugin has been developed and tested based on QGIS 3.34.8. (In older versions, the plugin might give
  unexpected behaviour)
- brdr needs Shapely 2.0.2 or higher. This version of Shapely is already available by default in QGIS version 3.34.8 and
  higher on Windows installations. On Linux and Mac this may not be the case. If the modules are not found, the plugin
  will attempt to install both 'brdr' and 'shapely' from Pypi.

## The brdrQ - PLUGIN

The brdrQ-plugin adds a toolbar, a toolmenu (vector) & a brdrQ processing provider (processing toolbox) with several
tools. You can find a link to the docs of each tool/script below.

### Tools/Scripts

- A custom tool (feature-by-feature):
    - **FeatureAligner (predictor)**: Custom tool to align feature-by-feature based on
      predictions [link to documentation](docs/featurealigner.md)
- a processing algorithm script (bulk):
    - **AutoCorrectBorders**:Processing algorithm to align polygons based on a specific relevant
      distance [link to documentation](docs/autocorrectborders.md)
    - **AutoUpdateBorders (GRB Updater)**: Processing algorithm to update/align features based on the actual situation of the GRB (Flanders - Belgium) [link to documentation](docs/autoupdateborders.md)
- Plugin version information: overview of the version of brdr and brdrQ

(Also note that these processing algorithms can also be used inside the QGIS ModelBuilder to 'chain' processes)

## Motivation & citation

The plugin uses `brdr`, a python-package to align thematic borders to reference borders.

- For more information about the conceptual method/algorithm consult:
  <https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/brdr>.

## Development

A released python-package of `brdr` is automatically installed when installing the brdrQ-plugin.

A non-released (development-) version of `brdr` can be installed as QGIS-Python-site-package by:

f.e. 'C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.38.1>python -m pip install C:\x\x\x\x\brdr'

the brdr-package is installed in a user-directory:

f.e. 'C:\Users\x\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\site-packages'
