    "text": "Q: My ‘local’ reference layer seems to slow down brdrQ. What can I do about it?\nA: Performance bottlenecks with reference layers are usually caused by how data is accessed and how efficiently it is searched. Even “local” layers can be slow due to two main factors: * Network Latency: If your data is stored on a network drive, a VPN share, or a cloud-synced folder (like OneDrive or Dropbox), QGIS must communicate with the server for every geometry calculation. This constant data transfer creates significant delays compared to reading directly from your hardware. * Missing Spatial Index: This is the most common technical bottleneck. Without a spatial index, QGIS must perform a “Full Table Scan.” This means to find a feature at a specific location, the tool has to check every single feature in the file one by one.\nTo significantly speed up your ‘local’ reference layer, implement the following optimizations: * Work Locally: Ensure your reference layer is stored on your computer’s internal SSD. Avoid running heavy analysis on files stored on network paths or external mechanical drives. * Create a Spatial Index: A spatial index acts like a “lookup table” for geometries. It allows the tool to instantly identify which features are in a specific area without scanning the entire dataset. * Use Efficient Formats: While Shapefiles are common, the GeoPackage (.gpkg) format is more modern and generally offers better performance for large datasets in QGIS.\nHow to add a Spatial Index in QGIS: Creating an index is a quick process that can be done directly within the layer settings:\n\nRight-click the layer in the Layers Panel and select Properties.\nNavigate to the Source tab.\nLook for the Geometry section.\nClick the Create Spatial Index button. (If the button is greyed out, an index is already present)."
