If the thematic data contains different geometries that show large differences in ‘deviation’, it is best to split the thematic data and process it separately with an appropriate RELEVANT_DISTANCE so that the RELEVANT_DISTANCE can be kept as small as possible.\nThe current version of the script assumes that both the thematic layer and reference layer are in the same CRS: Lambert72 (EPSG:31370) or Lambert 2008 (EPSG:3812).\nThematic boundaries consisting of 1 or a few reference polygons are processed by the script in a few seconds. If the thematic boundaries cover a very large area (~1000 and reference polygons), it may take several minutes for the OUTPUT to be calculated. It’s best to let QGIS finish this processing before proceeding\nIn practice, we notice that large thematic demarcations are sometimes drawn more roughly (less precisely or inaccurately), so that a high RELEVANT DISTANCE is required to shift them to the reference file. For large areas that are drawn ‘roughly’, it is best to use a high RELEVANT_DISTANCE (e.g. &gt;10 meters) and:\n\nOD-strategy EXCLUDE: if you want to completely exclude all public domain\nOD-strategy AS_IS: if you want to include all the covered public domain AS IS in the result\nOD strategy SNAP_SINGLE_SIDE: if you want to keep the public domain within the demarcation, but move the edges to the inner side of the thematic polygon\nOD strategy SNAP_ALL_SIDE: if you want to keep the public domain within the demarcation, but move the edges to the inner & outer side of the thematic polygon"

    "text": "Analyse your thematic dataset and try to gain insight into the ‘deviation’ (precision and accuracy from the reference layer):\n\nWhere does the thematic data come from?\nwhen was it created,\non what reference limits was it drawn at the time,\nWhich drawing rules have been applied (e.g. accuracy of 0.5m)\n…\n\n\nThis allows you to gain insight into the ‘deviation’ and which RELEVANT_DISTANCE value can best be applied.\n\nThe RELEVANT_DISTANCE must be chosen according to the ‘deviation’ of the thematic data compared to the reference layer. If the thematic data contains different geometries that show large differences in ‘deviation’, it is best to split the thematic data and process it separately with an appropriate RELEVANT_DISTANCE so that the RELEVANT_DISTANCE can be kept as small as possible.\nThe current version of the script assumes that both the thematic layer and reference layer are in the same CRS: Lambert72 (EPSG:31370) or Lambert 2008 (EPSG:3812).\nThematic boundaries consisting of 1 or a few reference polygons are processed by the script in a few seconds. If the thematic boundaries cover a very large area (~1000 and reference polygons), it may take several minutes for the OUTPUT to be calculated. It’s best to let QGIS finish this processing before proceeding\nIn practice, we notice that large thematic demarcations are sometimes drawn more roughly (less precisely or inaccurately), so that a high RELEVANT DISTANCE is required to shift them to the reference file. For large areas that are drawn ‘roughly’, it is best to use a high RELEVANT_DISTANCE (e.g. &gt;10 meters) and:\n\nOD-strategy EXCLUDE: if you want to completely exclude all public domain\nOD-strategy AS_IS: if you want to include all the covered public domain AS IS in the result\nOD strategy SNAP_SINGLE_SIDE: if you want to keep the public domain within the demarcation, but move the edges to the inner side of the thematic polygon\nOD strategy SNAP_ALL_SIDE: if you want to keep the public domain within the demarcation, but move the edges to the inner & outer side of the thematic polygon"
