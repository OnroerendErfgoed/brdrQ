# Welcome to the brdrQ-Documentation page

This plugin provides tools to align polygons to reference polygons.

here you can find links to the different tools that are currently provided:

* [Autocorrectborders](autocorrectborders.md) - Bulk alignment to reference layer
* [Feature aligner](featurealigner.md) - Feature-by-feature alignment with predictions
* [Autoupdateborders](autoupdateborders.md) - Bulk alignment to latest GRB (Flanders - Belgium) based on predictions and provenance

## Workflow
1. Use [Autocorrectborders](autocorrectborders.md) to align your thematic data to a reference layer. 
2. Output (CORRECTION layer) will be generated and a 'brdrq_state' is added.
3. Use [Feature aligner](featurealigner.md) to review and update the features that are not automatically updated according the 'brdrq_state'.
