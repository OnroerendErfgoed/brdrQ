# AutoUpdateBorders

`AutoUpdateBorders`: a QGIS-processing algorithm

## Description

`AutoUpdateBorders` is a QGIS-processing plugin that aligns features (polygons) to reference borders: It searches for overlap relevance between thematic borders and reference borders,
and creates a resulting border based on the overlapping areas that are relevant.
The algorithm can make (one or more) 'predictions' so the user can compare and choose the right aligned geometry.
